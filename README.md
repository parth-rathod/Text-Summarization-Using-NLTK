# Text-Summarization-Using-NLTK

Text summarization is a subdomain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of texts.
There are two main types of techniques used for text summarization: NLP-based techniques and deep learning-based techniques.
Here, we will see a simple NLP-based technique for text summarization.
We will simply use Python's NLTK library for summarizing Wikipedia articles.

Text Summarization Steps:-
1) Convert Paragraphs to Sentences
2) Text Preprocessing
3) Tokenizing the Sentences
4) Find Weighted Frequency of Occurrence
5) Replace Words by Weighted Frequency in Original Sentences
6) Sort Sentences in Descending Order of Sum
