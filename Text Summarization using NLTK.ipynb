      "A highly practical example of latent variable models in machine learning is the topic modeling which is a statistical model for generating the words (observed variables) in the document based on the topic (latent variable) of the document. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs. Some of the most common algorithms used in unsupervised learning include: 1) Clustering (2) Anomaly detection (3) Neural Networks (4) Approaches for learning latent variable models. A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, though unsupervised learning encompasses many other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. In the method of moments, the unknown parameters (of interest) in the model are related to the moments of one or more random variables, and thus, these unknown parameters can be estimated given the moments. It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. In particular, the method of moments is shown to be effective in learning the parameters of latent variable models. Generative adversarial networks can also be used with supervised learning, though they can also be applied to unsupervised and reinforcement techniques. Each approach again uses several methods as follow: The classical example of unsupervised learning in the study of neural networks is Donald Hebb's principle, that is, neurons that fire together wire together.\n"
